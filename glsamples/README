This is a set of OpenGL demos written by Nate Robins <nate@pobox.com>
that were packaged up to be more Linux-friendly. Windows-only files have
been removed, makefiles have been added, and Windows returns in the
source files have been replaced with Unix returns.('\r\n' -> '\n')

The original programs can be found on the web accompanied by full 
descriptions at http://www.xmission.com/~nate/sgi.html

To compile, type 'make' or 'make all'
To bring the package back to its initial form, type 'make clean'

A series of executables will be created, that you can simply run. They
are independand from each other. (Note: Executables for the "maiden" 
and "smooth" demos will be created in their respective directories)

I've compiled them on Redhat Linux 6.2 and Progeny Debian (Newton) with 
Mesa development packages, but should probably compile on any Linux/Unix
with a GL/Mesa installation.
